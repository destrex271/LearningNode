#Learning Node JS

## Express JS, View Engines(EJS) and Middlewares

###Express JS: 

Express is an npm module that allows you to easily build node js applications. Primarily used in setting up a server and the respective url routes on your webapp.

It provides almost the same functionality as the manage.py and the settings.py files in case of Django.

###View Engines(EJS):

View Engines like EJS can be used to pass on dynamic data to html templates/views. This dynamic data usually includes data pulled from a database.

The view engines, that are much similar to templates in django, allow us with the ability to use vanilla javascript code in our templates.

###Middlewares:
